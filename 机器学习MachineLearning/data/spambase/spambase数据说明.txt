The last column of 'spambase.data' denotes whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0), i.e. unsolicited commercial e-mail. Most of the attributes indicate whether a particular word or character was frequently occuring in the e-mail. The run-length attributes (55-57) measure the length of sequences of consecutive capital letters. For the statistical measures of each attribute, see the end of this file. Here are the definitions of the attributes: 

48 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type word_freq_WORD 
= percentage of words in the e-mail that match WORD, i.e. 100 * (number of times the WORD appears in the e-mail) / total number of words in e-mail. A "word" in this case is any string of alphanumeric characters bounded by non-alphanumeric characters or end-of-string. 

6 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type char_freq_CHAR] 
= percentage of characters in the e-mail that match CHAR, i.e. 100 * (number of CHAR occurences) / total characters in e-mail 

1 continuous real [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_average 
= average length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters 

1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_longest 
= length of longest uninterrupted sequence of capital letters 

1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_total 
= sum of length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters 
= total number of capital letters in the e-mail 

1 nominal {0,1} class attribute of type spam
